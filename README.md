## better-recycle-bin

A SharePoint Online WebPart that displays the Second-Stage (Site Collection) Recycle Bin in a sortable and filterable table.

The default Recycle Bin does not make it easy to find deleted files. This web part allows your search for files by name, path, deleted date, deleted by, or a combination of all of the above.

Tested on a production system, but use at your own risk.
Uses PNPJS and the SharePoint REST API.

You can download a packaged version [here](https://github.com/akennel/betterrecyclebin/blob/master/better-recycle-bin.sppkg?raw=true)
